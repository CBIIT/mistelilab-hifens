## README

This script is used to analyze siRNA screen data obtained with
High-Content Image analysis. In particular, the siRNA library used is
the ThermoFisher siKinome. The library contains 3 oligo siRNA sequences
per gene against 709 genes that have kinase domains. The library was
originally received dried in 96 well plates at 0.25 nM concentration. It
was resuspended in 50 ul ddH20 (5 uM final), frozen and then thawed to
increase oligo siRNA solubility. Column 12 of the 96-well plates was
left empty on purpose. The resuspended libraries (27 plates total), were
then trasnferred and compressed into 384-well format to obtain 7 Mother
plates (Plate 7 only contains 5 oligos and was left out from the final
analysis, hence we will have 704 genes at the end, not 709). For every
mother plate, 3 384-LDV daughter plates (13 ul each) were generated at
the same concentration. Columns 23 and 24 were originally left empty,
and siRNA controls were added at a later stage. All these steps were
performed using a PE Janus, which output all the liquid handling
operations logs as text files

Imaging assay-ready plates were generated by spotting 150 nl of siRNA
oligo at the bottom of each plate using an Echo525. Imaging Assay plates
were dried, frozen and then used in reverse transfection experiments.
For reverese transfection, plates were thawed, spinned and 20 ul of
Optimem + 0.05 ul/well of RNAiMax were added to the plates and incubated
for 30’. Then 20 ul of cells were added on top of the siRNA/RNAiMax mix
and incubated for 72 hrs.

Fixed and stained plates were imaged on an CV7000S microscope using a
40X air objectives and Z-stacks with slice interval of 1 micron.
Z-stacks were maximally projected on the fly. Images were analyzed in
Columbus 2.8.1, and image analysis results were exported as tab
delimited .txt files.

The script reads the Janus logs files, the Columbus image analysis
results and generates all the necessary .txt files for the analysis of
the siRNA screen results in `cellHTS2`. In addition, it also runs the
`cellHTS2` analysis and outputs an html report, .txt results tables, and
some custom plots of the z-score distributions.

### User variables input and settings specification

Choose a Columbus image analysis result variable that needs to be
analized in `cellHTS2`. This might change from analysis to analysis. The
chunk below assigns the Columbus variable chosen for analysis and sets
the `cellHTS2` input and output directories names accordingly .

``` r
well_tbl_2 <- read_tsv("HTS2_Input/Columbus_object_results.txt")
annotation_tbl <- read_tsv("HTS2_Metadata/Annotation.txt")

var_names <- well_tbl_2 %>% select(cell_n:FGFR2_Full_spots_TBP_norm) %>% names()
```
